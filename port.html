            <h2>History of Portugal</h2>
            <p><br>Portugal's history is a rich and varied tapestry, woven with the threads of ancient civilizations, maritime exploration, and cultural exchanges. From its prehistoric beginnings to its emergence as a modern nation-state, Portugal's past is marked by significant events and influential figures that have shaped its unique identity on the global stage.
                <br>
                The earliest human presence in Portugal dates back to the Paleolithic era, with significant archaeological sites like those found in the Côa Valley, which feature some of Europe’s most impressive rock art. The region was later inhabited by the Celts and subsequently integrated into the Roman Empire as the provinces of Lusitania and part of Gallaecia. Roman influence left a lasting imprint on the Portuguese territory, evident in its roads, architecture, and the spread of Christianity.
                <br>
                Following the decline of Roman authority, the Iberian Peninsula saw a series of invasions and settlements by Germanic tribes, including the Suebi and the Visigoths. However, the most transformative period in early Portuguese history came with the Moorish invasion in the 8th century. The Moors, who came from North Africa, occupied the region for several centuries, deeply influencing the culture, architecture, and agriculture of Portugal. Their presence is still felt today in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the Algarve.
                <br>
                The reconquest of these territories by Christian forces, known as the Reconquista, was completed in the 12th century, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal in 1139. Afonso Henriques was proclaimed the first king of Portugal after his victory at the Battle of Ourique. The kingdom’s borders were more or less defined with the Treaty of Zamora in 1143 and later solidified with the conquest of the Algarve in 1249.
                <br>
                Portugal's Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries marked the zenith of its maritime power and wealth. Under the patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese explorers ventured into previously uncharted parts of the Atlantic Ocean, discovering the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores. Explorers like Vasco da Gama and Pedro Álvares Cabral expanded Portuguese influence to Africa, India, and Brazil, establishing a vast colonial empire that would become a major economic, political, and military power in Europe.
                <br>
                This era of expansion was followed by a period of decline, beginning with the Iberian Union in 1580 when the crowns of Spain and Portugal were united under Spanish rule. This union lasted until 1640 when the Portuguese Restoration War led to the end of Spanish dominance.
                <br>
                The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, one of the deadliest earthquakes in history, devastated the capital city and had significant economic and social impacts. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Portugal faced further challenges, including the Napoleonic invasions, civil wars, and the eventual establishment of the First Republic in 1910 following the deposition of the monarchy.
                <br>
                The mid-20th century was marked by the Estado Novo, an authoritarian regime led by António de Oliveira Salazar. This period was characterized by political repression and economic stagnation. The regime was eventually overthrown by the Carnation Revolution in 1974, which led to significant social reforms and the decolonization of African territories such as Angola and Mozambique.
                <br>
                Since joining the European Union in 1986, Portugal has seen significant modernization and growth, although it faced considerable challenges during the economic crises of the early 21st century. Today, Portugal is known for its rich cultural heritage, vibrant democracy, and as a popular destination for tourists attracted to its historic cities, beautiful coastlines, and sunny climate.  </p>

                <h2>Top Touristic Spots in Portugal</h2><br><br>
                <h3>1. Lisbon</h3>

                    The Portuguese capital is packed with things to do, from browsing galleries (including the Museu Nacional do Azulejo with its trove of ceramic tiles) and exploring castles (such as the hilltop Castelo de São Jorge) to satisfying your sweet tooth with the city's incredible pastéis de nata (custard tarts).

                    <img src="Evora.jpg" alt="Evora">
                <p>The heart of the Alentejo region, Évora is one of Portugal’s most beautifully preserved medieval towns, and it's an enchanting place to spend a couple of days. Inside the 14th-century walls, narrow, winding lanes lead to striking monuments, including an elaborate medieval cathedral, Roman ruins and a picturesque town square.
                    <br>
                But this isn't a musty museum piece – Évora is also a lively university town, and its many restaurants serve up some excellent, hearty Alentejan cuisine.</p>

                    <img src="Minho.jpg" alt="Minho">
                <p>The Portuguese have a special fondness for the Minho, a verdant region of vineyard-covered valleys, mountainous wilds, isolated beaches and picturesque river towns that seem little changed by time. The gateway to the region is Braga, a city with Roman ruins, a fabled medieval cathedral, and tranquil flower-trimmed plazas sprinkled with outdoor cafes and restaurants. <br>

                    Further north, you’ll find Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, a vast, rugged wilderness of dramatic peaks, meandering streams and frozen-in-time stone villages. Dozens of hiking trails crisscross the reserve, taking walkers past old Roman roads, castle ruins or sparkling waterfalls.</p>
