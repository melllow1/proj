    <b>History:</b>Ayasofya has a long and diverse histoy that represents the changes that occurred throughout the history of Istanbul. From its construction in the 6th century until the Ottoman era in 1453, Hagia Sophia was originally used as a church. During the Ottoman period, it was converted into a mosque. In 1934, after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, under the direction of Turkey’s secularist founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, it became the Hagia Sophia museum. However, on July 24th, 2020, Hagia Sophia was officially converted into a mosque again under the direction of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

<b>Visiting Information:</b>Due to being converted from a museum into a mosque, Hagia Sophia is open 24 hours. During prayer times, however, you can only enter the visitor’s section. As with other mosques, women must cover their head and visitors must be dressed modestly.<br>
    Starting January 15th, 2024, the Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque implemented a new visitor management policy, separating worshippers from tourists visiting for cultural reasons. Tourists are charged a 25 euro entrance fee and can access the mosque's gallery floor, where they can view the sanctuary, Ottoman-era annexes, and Byzantine-era mosaics. The policy includes enhanced security measures, restoration efforts, and a QR code system providing information in 23 languages, aimed at preserving the site and improving visitor experience without disrupting worshippers.

    <b>Ephesus:</b>Ephesus is located near the western shores of modern-day Turkey, where the Aegean Sea meets the former estuary of the River Kaystros, about 80 kilometers south of Izmir, Turkey.

    According to legend, the Ionian prince Androclos founded Ephesus in the eleventh century B.C. The legend says that as Androclos searched for a new Greek settlement, he turned to the Delphi oracles for guidance. The oracles told him a boar and a fish would show him the new location.
    
    One day, as Androclos was frying fish over an open fire, a fish flopped out of the frying pan and landed in the nearby bushes. A spark ignited the bushes and a wild boar ran out. Recalling the oracles’ wisdom, Androclos built his new settlement where the bushes stood and called it Ephesus.
    
    Another legend says Ephesus was founded by the Amazons, a tribe of female warriors, and that the city was named after their queen, Ephesia

Six years after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror ordered the construction of the palace. The first part of the building was completed in 1465 under architect Alaüddin Davud Aga. With the completion of the outer protective walls in 1478, the initial construction of the palace was concluded.
    Throughout the centuries, subsequent Ottoman rulers consistently sought to expand and enhance the complex. Architects such as Davud Aga, Sarkis Balyan, Acem Ali, and the most renowned Ottoman architect, Mimar Sinan, were involved in these endeavor
