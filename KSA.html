    <p>

        and the reason is clearly due to its great religious status,
        as it is considered a destination for all Muslims from around the world.

        and in the language of numbers, Mecca is the seventh most visited
        city in the world with about 13.5 million visitors. Mecca,
        located in the west of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
        is the holiest city in Islam, and every year millions of Muslims
        from all over the world travel to it to perform the obligatory
        duties of Hajj and Umrah; What turns the city into one of the most
        popular destinations for religious reasons.

        The Mecca Gate, known popularly as the Quran Gate, sits on
        the western entrance of the city, which is the route from Jeddah.
        Located on Highway 40, it marks the boundary of the Haram area where
        non-Muslims are prohibited from entering. The gate was designed in 1979
        by an Egyptian architect, Samir Elabd, for the architectural firm IDEA Center.
        The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran,
        sitting on a rehal, or bookrest.

    <p>The ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masmak_Fort">Al-Masmak Palace</a> stands tall in the middle of the city of Riyadh. Its magnificence did not stand in the way of extending
    its splendor, so it turned into a tourist destination after being a silent witness to the momentous events in the history of the founding of
    the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <p>The palace was built in the fourteenth century AH, during the reign of Imam Abdullah bin Faisal, and it was his residence,
    and a house for rule and money. The palace is considered an impregnable fortress that protects against enemies, so it is distinguished by
    the strength and height of its walls. It has no windows, windows, or openings, except for two entrances and small openings that expand
    gun barrels during battles.</p>

    <h2  class="ksaheads">Masmak Palace Museum</h2>
    <ul>
        <li1>The museum was divided into 6 main parts, including its basic contents: the palace gate on the western side,
        the mosque, the Majlis - or the Diwaniyah as it is described locally -,
        the well on the northeastern side of it, the towers that are distributed in the four corners of the courtyard,
        and the residential units that were the ruler’s residence.
        and its guests were then converted into exhibition halls. You can wander through the entire history through visual displays
        inside the palace, and you will also see some ancient heritage pieces hanging on its walls.</li>    
        <li>On any day of the week, you can enjoy the ancient and immutable heritage,
        and learn about all aspects of the Kingdom’s history and its movements, from eight in the morning until nine in the evening.
        You can also view the museum’s official page to ensure that the time of your visit does not coincide
