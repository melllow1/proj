            Egypt is a country located in North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north,<br> the Gaza Strip and Palestine to the northeast,<br> the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west.<br> Here are some key points about Egypt:
        </p>
        <p id="t3">
          <b>History</b>: Egypt has one of the oldest civilizations in the world, dating back to around 3100 BC with the unification<br> of Upper and Lower Egypt by King Menes (Narmer). Ancient Egypt is famous for its pyramids, temples,<br> and the Sphinx. It was ruled by various pharaohs and underwent periods of great prosperity and influence.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="t3">
          <b>Geography</b>: The country is largely desert, dominated by the Nile River and its fertile delta. The Nile Valley and <br>Delta are the most significant areas of habitable land and are where most of Egypt's population resides.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="t3">
          <b>Culture</b>: Egyptian culture has been influenced by various civilizations throughout its history, including Greek, <br>Roman, Arab, and Ottoman. It has a rich cultural heritage, including ancient monuments, religious practices, literature, and art.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="t3">
          <b>Language</b>: Arabic is the official language of Egypt. English and French are also widely understood, especially in<br> urban areas and among educated populations.<br>
        </p>
        <p id="t3">
          <b>Religion</b>: Islam is the predominant religion in Egypt, with the majority of the population adhering to Sunni Islam.<br> There are also significant Christian communities, primarily Coptic Orthodox Christians, as well as smaller religious minorities.<br>   
        </p><hr>

     <h2>Best Places to visit in Egypt:</h2>
        <p id="t3">
                <b>Pyramids:</b>Giza or ‘Al Giza’ is undoubtedly a tourist hotspot in Egypt and the site of some of Ancient Egypt’s most 
                famous landmarks,most notably, the famous Pyramids of Giza
                <br>

            <img src="fatmapics/pyramids.jpg" alt="Pyramids of Egypt" style="float: right; width:100%;max-width:480px">
            <p id="t3">
                <b> history:</b>Amongst the pyramid complex may be found the pyramids of Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure. The largest pyramid in Giza – and the world! – belongs to the second king of the Fourth Dynasty, Khufu or “Cheops”.

                <br>Khufu’s pyramid is Giza’s oldest and, at its great size of 145 metres, became known as “The Great Pyramid”. In fact, Khufu’s pyramid was once the tallest structure in the world as well as being one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
                
                <br>The second largest pyramid in Giza belongs to Khufu’s son and fourth king of the Fourth Dynasty, Khafre (or Khephren).

The elevation on which Khafre’s pyramid is built is deceptive however, making it appear larger that his father’s.
                
                <br>The smallest of these three kings’ pyramids belongs to the sixth king of the Fourth Dynasty, Menkaure and is one-tenth the size of Khafre’s.
                
                <br>The Fourth Dynasty of Egypt ruled during a period known as the Old Kingdom, lasting between 2686 BC and 2181 BC. It was Egypt’s first great era of civilisation, and Pharaohs used the construction of pyramids such as those at Giza to exert their power, or sometimes as great tombs to hold their mummified bodies after death

                <b>location:</b>The Pyramids of Giza are located in Giza, 
                Egypt’s third-largest city around 10 miles from Cairo. Pre-arranged transit from Cairo is recommended, which is around a 30-minute drive away, however large tourist buses will also run to and from the Pyramids

            <p id="t3">
                <b>History:</b>Known as Ramesses the Great (sometimes spelt Ramses), Ramesses II is one of the most famous Egyptian pharaohs and formed part of the Nineteenth Dynasty. From 1279 BC, he built the temples at Abu Simbel as a way to immortalise himself, a feat he certainly seems to have achieved with these two vast structures and the large statues of himself which guard it.

                <br>The temples were carved directly into the sandstone outcrops located on the west bank of the Nile River, south of Aswan in the land of Nubia. These sacred temples were each dedicated to the gods as well as to Ramesses and his wife, Nefertari. The larger one, known as the Great Temple, honoured Re-Horakhti, Amon Ra and Ptah and the smaller, Hathor.

                <br>One of the most startling sights at Abu Simbel is the main hall of the Great Temple. This was also cut into the sandstone and along the hand hewn length are two rows of Osirid statues of Ramses, each one 30 feet high. Those on the north side wear the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the south side wear the double crown of Lower Egypt. This hall is precisely cut so that the early morning sun rays on 22nd of February and 22nd of October shine down the entire length to light up the back wall where the statues of four gods are seated.

                <br>Incredibly, the temples at Abu Simbel were once located elsewhere, but were moved – with the help of UNESCO – to their current location in order to protect them from flooding. The place they once stood is now under water.
            </p>
            <p id="t3">
                <b>location:</b>Abu Simbel is a small village in the southernmost region of Egypt, just 25 miles away from Sudan. The closest major city is Aswan. Abu Simbel has its own airport and a few hotels and hostels but Aswan provides more options to overnight.

                <br>Abu Simbel is about a three-hour drive away from Aswan and there are many tour operators that can take you there.

            <p id="t3">
                <b>Saqaura:</b>Roughly an hour’s drive from Cairo International Airport is one of Egypt’s greatest ancient sites. It’s called Saqqara, a vast area in the middle of a rather desert-like landscape that was once filled with stunning ancient Egyptian art and architecture.

                <br>It’s the ancient necropolis of the city of Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt, which was founded in 3000 BC by Menes.

Saqqara contains a host of burial chambers and pyramids, and is the oldest complete stone building complex in history.

            <img src="fatmapics/saquara.jpg" alt="Saqaura pyramid" style="float: right; width:100%;max-width:480px">
            <p id="t3">
                <b>History:</b>Now a UNESCO World Heritage site, Saqqara is home to 11 major pyramids sprawled over 6 miles. In total, Saqqara’s many pyramids were built across 3,000 years of ancient Egyptian civilisation, including those of the Fifth Dynasty kings Userkaf and Unas, to the incredibly well-preserved Pyramid of Teti I, built by the first ruler of the Sixth Dynasty.

                <br>Some believe that Teti I, whose queen is also buried at Saqqara, was assassinated by his bodyguard.
                
                <br>At one end of Saqqara, you have the world’s oldest known pyramid: the Step Pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser I. Dating to the time of Old Kingdom Egypt, this Pyramid was constructed more than 4,500 years ago.
                
                <br>At the other end of Saqqara is a massive subterranean complex known as the Serapeum. This was the home of the Apis Bull cult that thrived in Egypt during the latter half of the 1st millennium BC
            </p>
            <p id="t3">
                <b>location:</b>Saqqara is located in Egypt, around 17 miles south of downtown Cairo. The best way to get there is via a privately hired car or taxi, and it is recommended that you hire either for the full day so you may get around each of the site’s attractions easily. Alternatively, a number of hotels and travel agencies offer tours of Saqqara, which are often accompanied by a professional Egyptologist.

                <b>luxour temble:</b>
                The Luxor Temple in the city of Luxor, Egypt was once a sacred temple built in honour of the deity Amun. 
            </p>
            <img src="fatmapics/luxor temple.jpg" alt="Luxor Temple" style="float: right; width:100%;max-width:480px">
            <p id="t3">
                <b>History:</b>Constructed in the 14th century BC by Amenhotep III, the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, the Luxor Temple was part of the Ancient Egyptian city of Thebes.

                <br>The Ancient Egyptian temple complex of Luxor was founded in 1,400 BC and was expanded by 18th Dynasty Pharaohs Amenhotep III and Tutankhamun, and later by Ramesses the Great, and under the Roman Empire it was used as a fortress and government building.
                
                <br>The Romans constructed a military fort around the temple that the Arabs later called Al Uqsur (The Fortifications), which was later corrupted to give modern Luxor its name.
                
                <br>The Temple was also known as the Southern Sanctuary, its main function was during the annual Opet celebrations, when the statues of Amun, Mut and Khonsu were brought from Karnak, along the Avenue of Sphinxes, and reunited here during the inundation.
                
                <br>In the 14th century, a mosque was built in one of the interior courts for the local sheikh Abu Al Haggag. Excavation works, begun in 1885, have cleared away the village and debris of centuries to uncover what can be seen of the temple today, but the mosque remains and has been restored after a fire.

            <p id="t3">
                <b>location:</b>The temple of Luxor is located on the east bank of the Nile River, in Luxor city centre. It is accessible on foot, by bike, or by taxi from accommodation and other sites in Luxor.

            <p id="t3">
                <b>Karnak:</b>The Karnak Temple or rather the complex of temples of Karnak in Luxor, Egypt, is one of the most impressive of Ancient Egyptian sites and once formed part of the city of Thebes. Together with the Luxor Temple and the Valley of the Kings, the Karnak Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
            </p>
            <img src="fatmapics/Karnak.jpg" alt="Karnak Temple" style="float: right; width:100%;max-width:480px">
            <p id="t3">
                <b>History:</b>Sprawling over 2 square kilometres, the site known as the Karnak Temple was built in dedication to the god Amun and expanded by a succession of pharaohs, from those of the Middle Kingdom (1965-1920 BC) to the Ptolemaic dynasty (305 BC to 30 BC). The result is an incredible maze of temples, sanctuaries, sphinxes, columns and pylons amidst other ancient buildings and its name translates in Arabic as ‘fortified village’.

                <br>One of the most important and impressive sites at the Karnak Temple complex is the Temple of Amun-Ra, with its world famous Great Hypostyle Hall. Debate still continues as to whether this looming structure with its 69 foot columns was created by Amenhotep III or Seti I, although it was completed by Ramses II.Vast and full of fascinating sites, Karnak Temple is Egypt’s second-most visited site (following the Giza pyramids) and today constitutes Karnak Open Air Museum. Most people take a couple ofhours at the Karnak Temple, but this is only really enough to scratch the surface of this ancient complex, seeing only the Precinct of Amun-Re.

                <br>Closed to the public, the Precincts of Mut and Montu along with the deliberately dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV are in differing processes of restoration, having been used to build other buildings. Nevertheless, this unmissable site available to explore is an overwhelming ancient treasure, its pillars dramatically lit up with afternoon sunshine.
            </p>
            <p id="t3">
                <b>location:</b>Along the Nile River and on the outskirts of Luxor, the Karnak Temple is easily reached either on foot or via public transport – the temple is only a 40 minute walk from the train station with links to Cairo or Aswan. By car, Luxor is just off the 75 motorway and is a 15 minute drive from Luxor’s International Airport.
