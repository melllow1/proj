        <p7>Sucevita Monastery is one of the eight painted churches from <b style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Bucovina</b> that are included on the UNESCO World Heritage list.
          Known for its mesmerizing and inspirational Moldavian art, the monastery marked an end to an era where medieval religious art 
          reached a new level of innovation and creativity in Romania. Its paintings surpass all the highlights 
          of the previous one hundred years. Its rich and monumental external murals are the best conserved and the most impressive of all 
          the painted churches in Bucovina. Done by a local team of artists in the last years of the 16th century, the paintings illustrate 
          traditional themes, but also present new ones. The largest of all Moldavian wall paintings is also found here, 
          the Prayer of all Saints. The Northern wall has its own masterpiece, one of the most important in the entire Romanian medieval art, The
           Ladder of John Climax or The Ladder of Virtues, a theme inspired by Mount Athos traditions. This dazzling composition offers two 
           perspectives of the monastic afterlife, heaven for the most dedicated monks and hell with all its devils for those who disobeyed the rules.</p7>
