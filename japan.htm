        日本へようこそ, The Land of The Rising Sun.<br>
        Japan is a close-knit island nation that is known for its beautiful cities,
        <br> unique food, amusement parks, temples, shrines, hot springs, and more.

    <h1 class="cities">Tokyo</h1>
    <p>
        "Animated" is perhaps the best word to describe Tokyo. Crazy about its anime,<br>
        Japan's mega city is constantly buzzing with movement<br>
        and yet, bright lights and loud signs beg you to pause, to break your motion for just one second to pay<br>
        at the altar of consumerism. This is a city that feeds on motion and progress.<br>
        But when you want to stop in Tokyo, the city will certainly make it worth your while.<br>
        The tech-savvy locals may whizz past the monuments and urban parks daily, the museums and historical sites are world-class.<br>
        Here, there are photos to be taken, sushi to be eaten and a lot of shopping to be done.<br>
        So what are you waiting for? You better get a move on.<br><br>

        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            Senso-ji isn’t the capital city’s most popular just by default.<br>
            The atmosphere alone here is one for the bucket list. Senso-ji, the temple itself, is at the end of the shopping street,<Br>
            while a recently renovated five-story pagoda stands to the left (ranking in as the second tallest pagoda in Japan).<Br>
            Japanese visitors flutter around a large cauldron in front of the temple where <br>
            incense burned inside is said to benefit good health.<br>
            Travelers keen to avoid crowds should arrive early, but even tourists that are remotely interested in Japanese culture<br>
            will find something to appreciate here.

        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            A yellow sign marks the entrance to Harmonica Yokocho, which takes its name from the layout of the vendors,<br>
            slotted cheek-to-jowl along the passageways like the reeds in a harmonica. The atmospheric network of lanes<br>
            started out as a post-war flea market in the 1940s, but the area underwent a <br>
            transformation in the 90s when bustling bars and restaurants<br>
            made their entrance onto the scene. It has a laid-back and hyper-local feel, especially during the daytime,<br>
            when you’ll find fishmongers and traditional sweets makers plying their trades.<br>

        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            Topping off at 2,080 feet, the Tokyo Skytree is the tallest tower (that's tower, not building) in the world.<br>
            From the broadcast tower’s 360-degree observation decks, the whole city—its striking skyscrapers and neon <br>
            intersections—looks like a magical circuit board. It’s a major tourist attraction and a ticket isn’t cheap<br>
            (up to ¥3,400, or $25, for combo tickets), but even if you don’t pay to go inside, there’s no denying that<br>
            the Tokyo Skytree brought the skyline to a whole new level. Depending on where you’re staying, <br>
            it can be an out-of-the-way trip to eastern Tokyo<br>
            (luckily, a train station gets you right near the entrance). Families with children will enjoy the experience.<br>
            especially the speedy elevator rides—as will anyone that loves a jaw-dropping view.<br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p> 
        In conclusion, Tokyo is one of the most beautiful and mesmerizing capitals, and you should<br>
        definitely visit it someday.

    <h1 class="cities">Kyoto</h1>
    <p>
        Kyoto is the cultural heart of Japan. Visiting the shrines and temples, with their perfectly landscaped gardens and views over the city,<br>
        top the list for most visitors to Kyoto. But there are also bamboo groves and small neighborhoods to explore,<br>
        food markets and shopping streets to visit, and some very cool day trips that you can take.<br>
        The list of things to do in Kyoto is long. So long, in fact, that it would take you weeks to thoroughly explore this extraordinary city.
    </p>
    <h2 class="japanheads">Interesting facts about Kyoto:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For over 1,000 years Kyoto was the capital city of Japan. Tokyo took over this title in 1868.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Kyoto is one of the best-preserved cities in Japan. In World War II, it escaped bombing at the<br>
            intervention of Secretary of War Henry Stimson, and has remained Japan’s cultural center.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Kyoto has one of the world’s largest collections of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. <br>
            There are 17 UNESCO Sites, several of which make our list of the best things to do in Kyoto.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Kyoto has a MASSIVE network of trains and subways. Trying to get from one place to another can be mind-boggling at first,<br>
            as they are not all operated by the same company. Occasionally, you will have to purchase more than one ticket to travel<br>
            from point A to point B.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1. Fushimi Inari Taisha</h3>
    <p>
       The Fushimi Inari Shrine is one of the most important and iconic shrines in Kyoto.<br>
        Fushimi Inari honors the Shinto god of rice.<br><br>
       There are thousands of torii here, each donated by a company giving thanks for its<br>
        prosperity and hopes for a prosperous future. The name of each company is labeled on the torii.<br><br>
       For us, it was magical, walking through these tunnels of torii. Walking through<br>
        thousands of these gates, in the quiet forests on the outskirts of Kyoto, felt<br>
         peaceful and even a little bit mysterious.<br><br>

    <h3>2. The Higashiyama District</h3>
    <p>
        This historic district is a maze of narrow, paved streets and traditional wooden buildings.<br> <br>
        The Higashiyama District is the perfect place to visit if you like wandering picturesque streets, shopping, and hopping from café to café.<br><br>
        This part of Kyoto feels more traditional than some of the other districts in the city.<br><br>

        Mount Fuji
    </h1>
    <p>
        Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan) is with 3776 meters Japan's highest mountain. It is not surprising<br>
        that the nearly perfectly shaped volcano has been worshiped as a sacred mountain and<br>
         experienced big popularity among artists and common people throughout the centuries.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Mount Fuji is an active volcano, which most recently erupted in 1707. It stands on the border<br>
         between Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures and can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama on<br>
          clear days.</p>
